This Java program allows users to create a map of a school campus by placing buildings on a 12x12 grid. 
Users can add buildings by specifying coordinates, building numbers, and names, then view the updated map and list of all buildings. 
The program also provides directions between buildings, calculating distances in yards.
To get started, run the program, follow prompts to add buildings, and request directions as needed.
